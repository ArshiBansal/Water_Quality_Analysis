<h1 align="center">WATER QUALITY ANALYSIS (2017–2022) - Excel Dashboard 📊💧</h1>

Introduction 🌟

This Excel-based dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of water quality across Indian states from 2017 to 2022. By visualizing key indicators such as nitrate levels, fecal contamination, and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), the dashboard aims to uncover pollution patterns and environmental impacts. These insights support environmental agencies, researchers, and policymakers in implementing effective water management strategies.

Problem Statement ❓

Water pollution is a growing concern affecting ecosystems, public health, and economic sustainability. The challenge lies in identifying the major pollutants, understanding spatial and temporal patterns, and prioritizing areas for remediation. This project addresses the problem by analyzing multi-year water quality data across India to determine high-pollution zones, pollutant contributors, and trends. The goal is to provide actionable insights for improving water quality and promoting sustainability.

Project Overview 📋

This project delivers a comprehensive overview of India’s water quality trends over six years using Excel dashboards. Key indicators (KPIs) are summarized below:

1. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) 📏

a. Average pH: 7.55 ⚗️

b. Average BOD: 9.89 🌊

c. Average Nitrate: 4.07 🧪

d. Average PSI: 4.43 📉

e. Average Fecal Coliform: 2,754,037 (in millions) 🧫

f. Average Temperature: 25.1°C 🌡️

2. The dashboard includes multiple visualizations to highlight pollution sources, high-risk states and lakes, and year-wise pollutant trends.

Features ✨

1. Pollution Contribution Analysis: Pie chart showing contributions from fecal coliform, nitrates, BOD, pH, and DO.

2. State-wise Pollution Map: Choropleth map visualizing pollution intensity across Indian states.

3. Top Polluted Lakes & States: Rankings of top 10 polluted lakes and most affected states.

4. Trend Analysis: Line charts showing yearly trends of nitrate levels and fecal coliform counts.

5. State Comparison: Bar charts comparing nitrate and BOD scores by state.

6. Dissolved Oxygen Scatter Plot: Correlation plot between DO score and pollution indicators.

7. Interactive Filters: Filter by year, state, and water body type (lake, pond, tank, wetland).

Visualizations 📊

The Excel dashboard includes the following visualizations:

i. Pie Chart: Pollution contributor breakdown (%Fecal, %Nitrate, etc.)
ii. Choropleth Map: Geographic distribution of pollution scores across India
iii. Bar Charts: State-wise comparison of average BOD and nitrate scores
iv. Line Chart: Year-wise trend for nitrate and fecal coliform levels
v. Top 10 Lists: Most polluted lakes and states based on pollution score
vi. Scatter Plot: Analysis of dissolved oxygen levels across sampling points

Requirements ⚙️

1. Microsoft Excel (2016 or later recommended)

2. Basic Excel skills (slicers, pivot tables, chart editing)

Methodology 🧪

Steps followed in the analysis:

Data Collection 📥: Water quality data from 2017 to 2022 was compiled from environmental records.

Data Cleaning 🧹: Missing, invalid, or extreme values were cleaned and normalized.

Aggregation ⚙️: Metrics like average BOD, nitrate, and fecal coliform were calculated annually.

Visualization 📊: Interactive charts and slicers created using Excel Pivot Charts, Form Controls, and Conditional Formatting.

Dashboard Design 🖥️: Elements were laid out in a clean, navigable dashboard for ease of interpretation.

Insight Extraction 🔍: Trends and high-risk areas identified for environmental intervention.

Insights 💡

Fecal Contamination Dominates: Contributing ~44% to pollution, fecal coliform is the most significant threat.

Nitrate Levels Rising: Certain years show a steep increase in average nitrate levels.

Uttar Pradesh & Odisha: Among the most polluted states.

Gangondanahalli Lake: Registered highest pollution score (9.53).

DO Levels: Low dissolved oxygen values signal ecological stress in several water bodies.

Challenges 🚧

Data Availability: Limited access to granular-level data (e.g., rural monitoring stations).

Excel Limitations: Managing large datasets and complex interactivity can slow down performance.

Visualization Constraints: No dynamic mapping or advanced forecasting possible in Excel compared to BI tools.

Environmental Variables: Not all influencing factors (e.g., industrial runoff) are included in the dataset.

Future Work 🚀

Incorporate real-time monitoring data using Power Query or API integrations.

Expand coverage to district-level or river basin-level analysis.

Build forecast models to predict future pollutant levels.

Migrate to tools like Power BI or Tableau for deeper interactivity and visuals.

Include additional factors like heavy metals, land use data, or seasonal variation.
